# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The UIUC Study Space Finder is a web-based tool designed to help University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign students locate available study spaces in classrooms across campus. The system identifies rooms that are not currently being used for scheduled classes by scraping course schedule data, processing room availability information, and presenting it through an interactive campus map interface. This tool addresses the common challenge students face when searching for quiet, available spaces to study on campus.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a UIUC student, I want to view an interactive map of campus buildings, so that I can visually navigate and select buildings where I might want to study.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display an interactive map of the UIUC campus
2. WHEN the user views the map THEN the system SHALL show clickable building markers for academic buildings that contain classrooms
3. WHEN the user hovers over a building marker THEN the system SHALL display the building name
4. IF a building has available study spaces THEN the system SHALL highlight the building marker differently from buildings with no available spaces

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student looking for study space, I want to click on a campus building and see which rooms are currently available for studying, so that I can quickly identify open spaces without walking around campus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a building marker THEN the system SHALL display a list of available rooms in that building
2. WHEN displaying available rooms THEN the system SHALL show the room number and current availability status
3. WHEN displaying room information THEN the system SHALL indicate the time periods when each room is available for studying
4. IF no rooms are currently available in a building THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating no available spaces
5. WHEN the user views room availability THEN the system SHALL update the information based on the current day and time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student planning my study schedule, I want to see when specific rooms will be available throughout the day, so that I can plan my study sessions around class schedules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a specific room THEN the system SHALL display a schedule showing when the room is occupied by classes and when it's free
2. WHEN displaying room schedules THEN the system SHALL show time blocks in 30-minute increments from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM
3. WHEN showing availability THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between occupied time slots and available time slots
4. IF a room has upcoming availability THEN the system SHALL indicate when the next free period begins and how long it lasts
5. WHEN displaying schedules THEN the system SHALL account for the current day of the week and show relevant daily schedules

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to automatically collect and update classroom schedule data, so that room availability information stays current without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs its data collection process THEN it SHALL scrape course schedule information from the UIUC Course Explorer website
2. WHEN scraping course data THEN the system SHALL extract building names, room numbers, meeting days, and class times
3. WHEN processing scraped data THEN the system SHALL normalize room identifiers to a consistent format (building: room number)
4. WHEN new schedule data is collected THEN the system SHALL update the database with current room occupancy information
5. IF the scraping process encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log the errors and continue processing available data
6. WHEN updating room data THEN the system SHALL preserve historical availability patterns for system reliability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want room availability data to be stored in a structured database format, so that the application can efficiently query and serve availability information to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing room data THEN the system SHALL use a MongoDB database to persist room and availability information
2. WHEN structuring room data THEN the system SHALL store each room with its building identifier, room number, and associated schedule information
3. WHEN storing availability data THEN the system SHALL organize information by day of the week and time periods
4. WHEN the API receives requests for room data THEN the system SHALL query the database and return availability information in JSON format
5. IF database queries fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses to the frontend
6. WHEN storing schedule data THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as last update timestamp and data source information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a student using the application on different devices, I want the interface to be responsive and fast-loading, so that I can quickly check room availability whether I'm on my phone, tablet, or computer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the application on any device THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface that adapts to the screen size
2. WHEN the user interacts with the map THEN the system SHALL respond to clicks and touches within 500 milliseconds
3. WHEN loading building and room data THEN the system SHALL display the information within 2 seconds of user interaction
4. IF the user has a slow internet connection THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators during data retrieval
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL cache frequently accessed data to improve subsequent load times
6. WHEN displaying on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL ensure all interactive elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a student concerned about data accuracy, I want to see when room availability information was last updated, so that I can trust the reliability of the displayed information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views room availability data THEN the system SHALL display the timestamp of the last data update
2. WHEN the system updates room data THEN it SHALL record and store the update timestamp
3. IF room data is older than 24 hours THEN the system SHALL display a warning about potentially outdated information
4. WHEN displaying building information THEN the system SHALL indicate the freshness of the availability data
5. IF the data collection system fails to update THEN the system SHALL notify the admin and display a stale data warning to users
